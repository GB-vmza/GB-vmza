- 👋 Hi, I’m @GB-vmza
- Gerhard Botha, BEng working since 1990 on large drive systems, PLC, DCS etc. 
- Spent a few years developing PIC embedded systems at one point. 
- Now slowly but surely getting into ARM-cortex M and so I decided to join github!
- 
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
- Coding - C++ especially, safety applications, STM32 in general, GD32 range also. Played a bt with SAM and NXP too.
- Engineering - Large DC drive systems, Motor design and problem diagnosis, Large chopper designs (typically 1MW upwards)
- Private - Nature - I started a small farm, I like to observe and understand nature in general, I enjoy camping in the bush,
- fishing hunting, photography etc.
- 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...C++ and C. Have not been active for some time so becoming aquinted with concepts and standards after the stone age
- I mostly coded in assembler before...Learning C just to refresh a bit but more focussed on C++ with its many "modern" features. 
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...Anything in my limited skill range at this stage. When I find my feet propperly I would like to look at:
- C++ based safety focussed posix compliant RTOS variant
- STM32 HAL including USB from the ground up in C++
- Ways to make practical MCU concepts for industry. I have done things you should not with PIC's and Arduinos but lets face it: All the
- "maker"stuff is really for development only. We need a LEGO type system in the leauge of industrial PLC hardware to allow serious applications
- in low volume / mid-to-high value applications.
